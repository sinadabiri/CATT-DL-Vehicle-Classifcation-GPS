# A deep learning approach for vehicle classification using large scale GPS data

# Summary 
This is the project that I have done as an intern over the summer 2018 in [Center for Advanced Transportation Technologu] (http://www.catt.umd.edu/).

I have conducted two primary tasks in this project: 
**Labeling a large-scale GPS trajectory dataset based on the FHWA classification scheme.** An efficient programmatic approach is developed to label a large scale GPS data (~20 million GPS trajectory) by means of vehicle class information obtained from Virtual Weight Station vehicle records. Information from [open source routing machine API] (http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.5.1/api/#general-options) is also exploited to improve the accuracy of our labeling approach by extracting the map-based distance rather than the direct distance between coordinates.   


The project has been done over the summer 2018, as an intern in CATT/CATTWORKS
